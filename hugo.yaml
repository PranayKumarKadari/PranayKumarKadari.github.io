      I am a Research Technician at the [National Center for Soybean Biotechnology](http://www.soybiotechcenter.org/), University of Missouri-Columbia. My work integrates field experimentation, high  throughput plant phenotyping, laboratory analysis, and advanced data analytics to understand how how abiotic stress such as drought, heat and waterlogging influences root system architecture. This research aims to select the best germplasm or varieties resilient to crop stress and improve nutrient acquisition, supporting sustainable agriculture under changing environmental conditions.

       Hi,

       I am Pranay, a research Technician at [National Center for Soybean Biotechnology](http://www.soybiotechcenter.org/) at the University of Missouri.

       I was born and raised on a small farm in Telangana, in southern India. Helping out on the farm from a young age naturally made me curious not just about what we do in agriculture, but why we do it that way and how those choices shape crop performance and profitability. Motivated by this interest, I pursued my diploma and bachelor’s at Professor Jayashankar Telangana State Agricultural University (Formerly Acharya NG Ranga Agricultural University) with emphasis on soil science and agronomy. Later, I joined the University of Missouri at Columbia, as a Graduate Research Assistant under [Dr. Gurbir Singh](https://cafnr.missouri.edu/directory/gurbir-singh/) and completed my M.S. in Plant, Insect, and Microbial Sciences and a Graduate Certificate in Geographic Information Systems. My thesis research focused on developing GIS-based nutrient management zones for nitrogen management and evaluating how nitrogen rate and timing strategies, nitrification inhibitors, and soil conservation strategies influence soil health, nitrogen uptake, losses through leaching and gaseous pathways, crop productivity, and profitability.

       Currently, as a Research Technician in [Dr. Henry Nguyen’s lab](https://cafnrfaculty.missouri.edu/nguyenlab/), I study root system architecture and plasticity under abiotic (waterlogging, drought, heat, and low soil fertility) and biotic stresses (nematodes) using high-throughput root phenotyping technologies, with an emphasis on identifying root traits associated with stress tolerance and improved resource-use efficiency.

       I am interested in understanding how environmental stressors and crop management practices alter plant functional traits and influence nutrient cycling, soil health and crop productivity. My long-term goal is to develop systems-based approaches that improve nutrient uptake efficiency, reduce nutrient losses, and enhance crop productivity and profitability by translating mechanistic insights into actionable management strategies for farmers.

        description:
          - The overarching goal of this collaborative research (between Donald Danforth Plant Science Center and the University of Missouri) is to improve climate resilience in soybean by identifying root architectural traits and plastic responses that enhance nutrient acquisition under drought stress conditions.
          - The specific objectives of this project are to (i) characterize genotypic variation in soybean root system architecture, (ii) quantify root trait plasticity in response to water stress, and (iii) identify root traits associated with improved nutrient uptake and stress resilience under drought-prone environments.
          - To achieve these objectives, the project integrates high-throughput root phenotyping approaches, including: 1. Shovelomics for field-based excavation and characterization of root architectural traits. 2. Root imaging using industrial monochrome cameras and the RhizoVision Imager platform. 3. Root trait extraction and analysis using RhizoVision Explorer and RhizoWin software for quantitative root phenomics.

        description:
          - The objective of this study is to quantify the impact of varying waterlogging durations on grain yield and key aboveground agronomic traits across selected crop germplasm. Specifically, this project aims to (i) evaluate yield sensitivity to short- and prolonged waterlogging stress, (ii) characterize genotypic variation in agronomic responses to excess soil moisture, and (iii) develop predictive models to estimate yield loss and associated production risk under waterlogging conditions.
          
          - Methodology includes a split-split plot field design to impose waterlogging treatments across germplasm, collection of grain yield and key aboveground agronomic traits, multispectral UAV imaging during peak stress and recovery, and machine learning–based prediction of yield loss and production risk.

          - "A high-throughput root phenotyping platform was developed to quantitatively characterize root system architecture (RSA) and to identify architectural and developmental traits associated with tolerance to waterlogging stress during the reproductive growth stage in soybean. A diverse panel of soybean germplasm was evaluated using a semi-automated rhizoslide-based phenotyping system, allowing non-destructive, multi- stage imaging of root growth and development. Root image segmentation, trait extraction, and quantitative analysis were conducted using RootPainter and RhizoWin software to derive standardized morphological and architectural root traits."
